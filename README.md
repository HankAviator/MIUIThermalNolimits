# MIUIThermalNolimits
Magisk module.

Replace Nolimits thermal conf to all other confs on MIUI for MI 11 Pro (`mars`) and MI 11 Ultra (`star`), so that the limit for maximum CPU frequency of all cores are lifted. Supports MIUI 12.

Recommended to use `conservative` governor for daily usage to better battery life.
