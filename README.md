# MIUIThermalNolimits
Magisk module.

Replace all thermal conf with Nolimits confs on MIUI for MI 11 Pro (`mars`) and MI 11 Ultra (`star`), so that the limit for maximum CPU frequency of all cores is lifted. This will enforce maximum charging speed while screen is on, instead of official fast charge when the screen is off only. **Supports MIUI 12 and MIUI 13.**

Recommended to use `conservative` governor for daily use to prolong battery life.
