# MIUIThermalNolimits
Magisk module.

Replace all thermal conf with Nolimits confs on MIUI for MI 11 Pro (`mars`) and MI 11 Ultra (`star`), so that the limit for maximum CPU frequency of all cores is lifted. **Supports MIUI 12 and MIUI 13.**

Recommended to use `conservative` governor for daily use to prolong battery life.
